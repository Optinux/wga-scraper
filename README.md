## TODO:

- implement the optional use of proxies in order to circumvent ratelimiting / ip-banning
- export it as a .jar with a somewhat decent cli
- make all DEBUG stuff optional (silent switch)
- create Usage Paragraph in this README
- make it use the entire database in its raw form instead of relying on an already trimmed down version
